- - where do I see proxime device location
  - Our system will allow you to view your device(s) location(s) through three ways :- via the internet, via your internet enabled mobile phone, or via our mobile app.

- - where all will the device track or locate
  - Our system is designed to locate a ProxiME Device anywhere in the world (with NO ADDITIONAL costs or roaming fees) as long as there is GSM cellular service area. If the device enters an area without GSM cellular coverage, the GPS feature will not be able to report its current location until it re-enters an area with network coverage. Once it reconnects, it will transmit a history of its locations that you can view online.

- - how does the accuracy of my Proxime Device improve over time
  - The initial location is the hardest as the ProxiME device is connecting for the first time with the satellites and figuring out where in the world it is. Most often this requires taking the device outside for 5 or more minutes. If activating in a home you may notice the initial location reported is approximate to your home but not very accurate, as your locator continues to gather data outside.
